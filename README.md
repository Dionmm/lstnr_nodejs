# LSTNR


A site that utilises the Spotfiy and Youtube APIs to allow users to create huge playlists of content from both sites.

Disclaimer: Due to restrictions from both APIs (30 seconds songs for Spotfiy, limited playback on external sites for Youtube) it's more of a tech demo/learning adventure than an actual 100% perfect product
